## How machine learning algorithms work?
- In this repository, you can find mathematical explanation of ML algorithms and how to implement them in python from scratch.

### Here are the methods used to implement the algorithms:
- Linear Regression 
    - Gradient Descent
- Logistic Regression
    - Gradient Descent
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Euclidean Distance
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - Gradient Descent on Hinge Loss
